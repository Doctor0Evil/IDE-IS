# TODO-NEXT (Repository roadmap and immediate tasks)

1. Merge `feat/idechat-baseline` PR.
2. Add .devcontainer/ for consistent Node/ALN tooling and tasks. (done)
3. Create `Makefile` with `test`, `validate-config`, `routing-check`, and `ci` targets. (done)
4. Wire DID validation into CI (`ci-tools/check-aln-structure.mjs`). (done)
5. Add `examples/runtime-stub` and `Makefile` target `runtime-stub`. (in-progress)
6. Publish `Doctor0Evil/IDE-Chat` repository (create remote repo and push main).
7. Set up branch protection and enable Dependabot and secret scanning.
8. Add `CODEOWNERS` for `core/` and `adapters/`.
9. Create `release/v0.1.0` tag and draft release notes.
10. Document VS Code integration and add a devcontainer/Makefile CI badge to README. (in-progress)

PR Gate:
- Script: `scripts/pr-environment-gate.sh` performs environment checks before opening/updating PRs.
- Usage: run `scripts/pr-environment-gate.sh` locally (or in devcontainer) before creating PR. If it fails, fix issues locally and re-run.

Auto-repair stub:
- Script: `scripts/pr-auto-repair.mjs <path-to-log> [--apply]` parses logs, suggests patches and can apply minimal fixes (dry-run by default).

## DID / Web5 integration roadmap
- Implement `didSession.autoAuthForPR` as an ALN module and doc how it replaces PAT-based auth.
- Implement `didSecrets.serviceCapability` and `didSecrets.zeroTrustRunner` as ALN specs for CI runners.
- Add `docs/DID-INTEGRATION.md` describing how IDE-Chat will use Web5 DIDs, verifiable credentials, and DWNs in lieu of GitHub Secrets.
- Mark these tasks as planned; do not attempt to enact DID-based authentication in this PR. Create ALN skeletons and docs only.
